# ABTesting
The simpler ABTesting library

**Work in progress! We at Fewlaps need a simple A/B Testing library. We looked for it on Android Arsenal, and it seems that most of them needs a server to update the values of the tests in realtime. But we don't need that, so... let's develop it. In addition, we're doing it on Kotlin. So, if you want to see some Kotlin code or practice developing on Kotlin, don't hesitate to send a lovely PR!
